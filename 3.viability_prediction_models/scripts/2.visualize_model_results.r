# The plot above shows each model's top-10 features are spread out with
# a long tail of Tukey-fence "edge" values (already computed as
# fence_low/fence_high in feature_dist_df) - but that plot works on
# CONSENSUS profiles, one row per (patient, treatment, dose) condition,
# not per physical specimen. To actually go find and re-inspect the
# organoids/cells behind those edge values under the microscope, we
# need the pre-aggregation, per-object profiles - each row there is one
# real organoid or cell with its own segmentation centroid.
#
# organoid_flagged_outliers.parquet / sc_flagged_outliers.parquet (per
# patient, in 4.qc_profiles/) are the earliest per-object tables that
# still carry both the raw feature values and the
# <compartment>_NoChannel_VolumeSizeShape_{Center,Min,Max}{X,Y,Z} columns -
# everything downstream of QC aggregates them away. Pulling the min/max
# bounding box in here too (not just the center) means every downstream
# table - edge_objects_df, extreme_objects_df - already carries what's
# needed to crop the raw image directly, instead of having to re-read
# this same QC parquet a second time later just for the bbox. Read only
